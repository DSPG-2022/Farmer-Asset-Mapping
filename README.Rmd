## Overview

Welcome to the Beginning Farmer's Asset Mapping Github repository. Here, you can find all of the documents, data sets and project materials used in constructing this project. This file serves as an introduction to the information that is contained in the directories of this repository.

### Structure

-  All of the work dealing with scripting in R, working in Tableau, and the cleaning of data sets can be accessed through the `Data Exploration` folder. This folder contains all of the data content of the project and would be the folder to look through for any information on how the visualizations were created. 
    + The `Datasets` folder contains all data sets used in this project. For this project, the data sets folder is split into two additional folders titled `EXTRACTIONS` and `RAW`. Both of these folders are directories that the SSURGO data generates to store the information. 
    + The `R Projects` folder contains all of the R scripts used for experimenting, merging and formatting soil, weather and crop data. All of the R projects are connected to the `Data Exploration.Rproj` file.
    + The `Tableau Projects` folder contains all of the Tableau workbook files that were used to test and later create the dashboard. The final dashboard is stored in `Cory - Tableau > CropSelectionFinal.twbx`.
    + The `Web Projects` folder contains all of the work that went into creating the local user interface building. `Leaflet Test` is a test folder for experimenting with Leaflet, `TestPHP` is the folder which runs PHP scripts to collect information from user input to R and `web_testing_docs` is a template of PHP and R testing scripts.



- The [Beginning Farmer's Asset Mapping Web Page](https://dspg-2022.github.io/Farmer-Asset-Mapping/index.html) which contains all of the finished documentation and the final dashboard of the project is auto-generated by the `pkgdown` library for R using vignettes. Only a few of the remaining directories in this repository are not auto-generated.
    + The `vignettes` folder contains all of the R Markdown files that are used to create the html websites of the project.
    + The `pkgdown` folder contains a single `_pkgdown.yml` file which allows for additional structuring of the webpage when auto-generated.
    + The `index.md` file serves as the Home page of the [Beginning Farmer's Asset Mapping Web Page](https://dspg-2022.github.io/Farmer-Asset-Mapping/index.html)
