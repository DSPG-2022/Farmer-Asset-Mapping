## Overview

Welcome to the Beginning Farmerâ€™s Asset Mapping Github repository. Here,
you can find all of the documents, data sets and project materials used
in constructing this project. This file serves as an introduction to the
information that is contained in the directories of this repository.

### Structure

-   All of the work dealing with scripting in R, working in Tableau, and
    the cleaning of data sets can be accessed through the
    `Data Exploration` folder. This folder contains all of the data
    content of the project and would be the folder to look through for
    any information on how the visualizations were created.
    -   The `Datasets` folder contains all data sets used in this
        project. For this project, the data sets folder is split into
        two additional folders titled `EXTRACTIONS` and `RAW`. Both of
        these folders are directories that the SSURGO data generates to
        store the information.
    -   The `R Projects` folder contains all of the R scripts used for
        experimenting and calculating data. All of the R projects are
        connected to the `Data Exploration.Rproj` file.
    -   The `Tableau Projects` folder contains all of the Tableau
        workbook files that were used to create the visualizations.
-   The [DHR Disabilities Web
    Page](https://dspg-2022.github.io/DHR-Disabilities/) which contains
    all of the finished documentation and visualizations of the project
    is auto-generated by the `pkgdown` library for R using vignettes.
    Only a few of the remaining directories in this repository are not
    auto-generated.
    -   The `vignettes` folder contains all of the R Markdown files that
        are used to create the html websites of the project. The folder
        contains `images` and `Dashboard_Development` folders to help
        structure the webpage.
    -   The `pkgdown` folder contains a single `_pkgdown.yml` file which
        allows for additional structuring of the webpage when
        auto-generated.
    -   The `index.md` file serves as the Home page of the [DHR
        Disabilities Web
        Page](https://dspg-2022.github.io/DHR-Disabilities/)
