## Overview

Welcome to the Beginning Farmer's Asset Mapping project page! This is the home of the dashboard and documentation that the DSPG 2022 team worked hard to complete this summer. Below you can find navigational links which will take you across the different sections of this webpage. Alternatively, you can use the top navigation bars to view information by title.

The __Dashboard__ section contains the finalized visualization for this project's dashboard containing all of the interactive elements and tables the user would want to see. The __Dashboard Development__ section contains all of the methodology, processes, and review of the data sources that went into creating the scripting and dashboard development for this project.

The presentation slides can be accessed <a href=https://github.com/DSPG-2022/DHR-Disabilities/blob/main/man/figures/PresSlides.pdf>here</a> and the recorded final presentation [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SG259_CYy2k)
