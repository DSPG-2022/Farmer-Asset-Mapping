The following map units were updated for Fiscal Year 2021:
The 118 Garwin silty clay loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes map unit was updated through the MLRA 108C - Garwin soils project. This project impacted multiple map units spatially that led to modifications of map unit acreages.
Some spatial edits were made to this county to include new map units or adjust existing ones.  All spatial data edits were certified correct by the Soil Survey region GIS specialist, and by the National Digitizing Center. The SSS certified the data population for all map units, and concurred with correlation of all projects mentioned, as they were documented in Soil Survey Area Legend(s), and in the Project Correlation tables.  This dataset also has recalculated all national, regional, and local interpretations for all components.
