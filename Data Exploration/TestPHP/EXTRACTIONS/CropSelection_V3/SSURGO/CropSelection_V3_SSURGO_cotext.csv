This component is on interfluves on dissected till plains. The parent material consists of fine-silty loess. Depth to a root restrictive layer is greater than 60 inches. The natural drainage class is somewhat poorly drained.  Water movement in the most restrictive layer is moderately high.  Available water to a depth of 60 inches (or restricted depth) is high.  Shrink-swell potential is moderate. This soil is not flooded. It is not ponded. A seasonal zone of water saturation is at 12 inches during April. Organic matter content in the surface horizon is about 5 percent. This component is in the R108CY516IA Wet Loess Upland Flat Prairie ecological site. Nonirrigated land capability classification is 1.  This soil does not meet hydric criteria.  There are no saline horizons within 30 inches of the soil surface. ,22073927,22403502
